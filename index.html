		<h1>Assignent 1</h1>
		<p>The first group assignment was to visualize some set of information. Our group (named Gangnam Style) created a circular representation of the courses included in our study program at Information Networks, Aalto University.</p>
		<p>On the technical side, the visualization is made with <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>, using a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/">plugin</a> to facilitate development in the Eclipse IDE.</p>
